# Kernelized Logistic Regression
Three flavors of gradient descent learning using a Kernel Function on high dimensional dataset...

For more details about the implementation refer to Problem 5 of the Homework 3.pdf file.

The three flavors of gradient descent implemented are:

1. Batch Gradient Descent
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (1 Point)
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent (100 Points)
